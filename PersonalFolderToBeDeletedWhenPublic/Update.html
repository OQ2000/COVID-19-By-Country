<h3 id="what-we-need-to-discuss">What we need to discuss</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is going to be an expansion of this dataset(E.g What can we do to make more people be able to use it?)</li>
<li>How can we advertise this?</li>
<li>What are we doing for the database(Like we need to be more specific like are we making it to be used as an API to allow people to get data from  a website using our dataset)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whats-to-be-done">Whats to be done</h3>
<ul>
<li>Database</li>
<li>Excel Dashboard(Just for shits and giggles and allows both of us to say look how big are balls in excel are)</li>
<li>Add calculations fields to the master dataset(Right now they are only on the separate country files)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="update">Update</h3>
<ul>
<li>I created this folder that will be deleted after we make the repository public(Which I think should be soon)</li>
<li>I added all the python code that I used.</li>
<li>I also created a quick and easy version control system that we can use for releases(I think we should work on trying to release the first version meaning that people will be able to download the repository easier)</li>
<li>The version control works as follows:</li>
</ul>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">C-19</th>
<th align="center">No Of Current Open issues</th>
<th align="center">No Of Commits</th>
<th align="center">No Of Releases</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">C-19.</td>
<td align="center">2.</td>
<td align="center">75.</td>
<td align="center">0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>So as we release more versions the last number will update if none else do<br>
Eg<br>
<strong><br>
First version - C-19.2.75.0<br>
Next version - C-19.2.75.1<br>
</strong><br>
There is a python program in: COVID-19-By-Country\PersonalFolderToBeDeletedWhenPublic\Testing<br>
Called <a href="http://NamingConvetion.py">NamingConvetion.py</a><br>
That basically does as described as above except formats all correctly and generates the version number based on 3 inputs,</p>
